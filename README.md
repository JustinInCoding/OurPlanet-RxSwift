> This project is for me to learn from kodeco's iOS courses. Here I try to grasp the knowledge of RxSwift by recording the steps of learning how useful combineLatest can be in several situations, but you’ll also exercise startWith, concat, merge, reduce and scan. Of course, you’ll also rely on operators you are already familiar with, like map(_:) and flatMap(_:).
